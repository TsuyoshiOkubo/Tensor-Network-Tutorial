# Tensor-Network-Tutorial
Slide of main lecture: "[Tensor network approach to two-dimensional frustrated spin systems](Slide/CMEQM_20221124.pdf)" 

Here we share sammple codes for the Hands-on tutorial of basics of Tensor networks.
There are three types of exercises.
To run ipynb on Google Colab, please see the instruction ([Exercises.pdf](Slides/Exercises.pdf)) 


## Ex1
Calculate entanglement entropy of 
* Random vector (Ex1-1)
* Ground state of 1d spin models  (Ex1-2)
* Picture image (Ex1-3)

## Ex2
Perform MPS approximation of
* Random vector (Ex2-1)
* Ground state of 1d spin models  (Ex2-2)
* Picture image (Ex2-3)

## Ex3
TEBD / iTEBD simulation for 1d spin models.
* TEBD for finite system (Ex3-1)
* iTEBD for infinite sytems (Ex3-2)
