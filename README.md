## Basics of tensor networks
Here we share sample codes for the hands-on tutorial of basics of Tensor networks.
There are three types of exercises.
To run ipynb on Google Colab, please see the instruction ([Exercises.pdf](Slides/Exercises.pdf)) 

### Ex1
Calculate entanglement entropy of 
* Random vector (Ex1-1)
* Ground state of 1d spin models  (Ex1-2)
* Picture image (Ex1-3)

### Ex2
Perform MPS approximation of
* Random vector (Ex2-1)
* Ground state of 1d spin models  (Ex2-2)
* Picture image (Ex2-3)

### Ex3
TEBD / iTEBD simulation for 1d spin models.
* TEBD for finite system (Ex3-1)
* iTEBD for infinite sytems (Ex3-2)

## Hands-on tutorial of TeNeS
TeNeS is an open-source software for simulation the ground state of two-dimensional lattice models by iTPS.
* [GitHub](https://github.com/issp-center-dev/TeNeS)
* [Official web page](https://www.pasums.issp.u-tokyo.ac.jp/tenes/en)

Here we share slide for the tutorial of TeNeS. ([TeNeS_tutorial.pdf](Slides/TeNeS_tutorial.pdf))  

In this tutorial we assume that the TeNeS is used with [MateriApps Live!](https://github.com/cmsi/MateriAppsLive). So, if you try it, please prepare your virtual Linux enviroment by MateriApps Live as

* [Virtual box (For windows and intel Mac)](https://github.com/cmsi/MateriAppsLive/wiki/GettingStartedOVA-en)
* [Docker (For Mac)](https://github.com/cmsi/MateriAppsLive/wiki/GettingStartedDocker-en)
